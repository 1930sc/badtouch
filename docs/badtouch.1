badtouch \- scriptable network authentication cracker

.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fBscripts\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
badtouch is a scriptable network authentication cracker. While the space for
common service bruteforce is already very well saturated, you may still end up
writing your own python scripts when testing credentials for web applications.

The scope of badtouch is specifically cracking custom services. This is done by
writing scripts that are loaded into a lua runtime. Those scripts represent a
single service and provide a `verify(user, password)` function that returns
either true or false. Concurrency, progress indication and reporting is
magically provided by the badtouch runtime.
